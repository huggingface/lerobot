    """
    Converts gripper actions from continuous to binary values (0 and 1).

    We exploit that fact that most of the time, the gripper is fully open (near 1.0) or fully closed (near 0.0). As it
    transitions between the two, it sometimes passes through a few intermediate values. We relabel those intermediate
    values based on the state that is reached _after_ those intermediate values.

    In the edge case that the trajectory ends with an intermediate value, we give up on binarizing and relabel that
    chunk of intermediate values as the last action in the trajectory.

    The `scan_fn` implements the following logic:
        new_actions = np.empty_like(actions)
