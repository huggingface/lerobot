## Bonus: Motor Debugging on Linux/macOS

For debugging purposes only, you can use the open-source Feetech Debug Tool:

- **Repository**: [FT_SCServo_Debug_Qt](https://github.com/CarolinePascal/FT_SCServo_Debug_Qt/tree/fix/port-search-timer)

### Installation Instructions

Follow the instructions in the repository to install the tool, for Ubuntu you can directly install it, for MacOS you need to build it from source.

**Limitations:**

- This tool is for debugging and parameter adjustment only
- Firmware updates must still be done on Windows with official Feetech software
