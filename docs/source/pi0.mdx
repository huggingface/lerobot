# π₀ (Pi0)

π₀ is a **Vision-Language-Action model for general robot control**, from Physical Intelligence. The LeRobot implementation is adapted from their open source [OpenPI](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) repository.

## Model Overview

π₀ represents a breakthrough in robotics as the first general-purpose robot foundation model developed by [Physical Intelligence](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0). Unlike traditional robots that are narrow specialists programmed for repetitive motions, π₀ is designed to be a generalist policy that can understand visual inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and control a variety of different robots across diverse tasks.

### The Vision for Physical Intelligence

As described by Physical Intelligence, while AI has achieved remarkable success in digital domains, from chess-playing to drug discovery, human intelligence still dramatically outpaces AI in the physical world. To paraphrase Moravec's paradox, winning a game of chess represents an "easy" problem for AI, but folding a shirt or cleaning up a table requires solving some of the most difficult engineering problems ever conceived. π₀ represents a first step toward developing artificial physical intelligence that enables users to simply ask robots to perform any task they want, just like they can with large language models.

### Architecture and Approach

π₀ combines several key innovations:

- **Flow Matching**: Uses a novel method to augment pre-trained VLMs with continuous action outputs via flow matching (a variant of diffusion models)
- **Cross-Embodiment Training**: Trained on data from 8 distinct robot platforms including UR5e, Bimanual UR5e, Franka, Bimanual Trossen, Bimanual ARX, Mobile Trossen, and Mobile Fibocom
- **Internet-Scale Pre-training**: Inherits semantic knowledge from a pre-trained 3B parameter Vision-Language Model
- **High-Frequency Control**: Outputs motor commands at up to 50 Hz for real-time dexterous manipulation

## Installation Requirements

⚠️ **Warning**: This policy requires patching the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have the exact version installed:

   ```bash
   pip show transformers
   ```

   It must be version **4.53.2**.

2. Apply the custom patches:
   ```bash
   cp -r ./src/lerobot/policies/pi0_openpi/transformers_replace/* \
     $(python -c "import transformers, os; print(os.path.dirname(transformers.__file__))")
   ```

### What the patches do:

- Support the **AdaRMS optimizer**
- Correctly control the precision of activations
- Allow the KV cache to be used without updates

**Important Notes:**

- This permanently modifies your `transformers` installation
- The changes survive reinstalls unless you explicitly remove the patched files or recreate the environment

### Restoring Clean State

To undo the patches and restore a clean state:

```bash
pip uninstall transformers
pip install transformers==4.53.2
```

## Training Data and Capabilities

π₀ is trained on the largest robot interaction dataset to date, combining three key data sources:

1. **Internet-Scale Pre-training**: Vision-language data from the web for semantic understanding
2. **Open X-Embodiment Dataset**: Open-source robot manipulation datasets
3. **Physical Intelligence Dataset**: Large and diverse dataset of dexterous tasks across 8 distinct robots

## Usage

To use π₀ in LeRobot, specify the policy type as:

```python
policy.type=pi0_openpi
```

## Training

For training π₀, you can use the standard LeRobot training script with the appropriate configuration:

```bash
python src/lerobot/scripts/train.py \
    --dataset.repo_id=your_dataset \
    --policy.type=pi0_openpi \
    --output_dir=./outputs/pi0_training \
    --job_name=pi0_training \
    --policy.pretrained_path=pepijn223/pi0_base_fp32 \
    --policy.repo_id=your_repo_id \
    --policy.compile_model=true \
    --policy.gradient_checkpointing=true \
    --policy.dtype=bfloat16 \
    --steps=3000 \
    --policy.scheduler_decay_steps=3000 \
    --policy.device=cuda \
    --batch_size=32
```

### Key Training Parameters

- **`--policy.compile_model=true`**: Enables model compilation for faster training
- **`--policy.gradient_checkpointing=true`**: Reduces memory usage significantly during training
- **`--policy.dtype=bfloat16`**: Use mixed precision training for efficiency
- **`--batch_size=32`**: Batch size for training, adapt this based on your GPU memory
- **`--policy.pretrained_path=pepijn223/pi0_base_fp32`**: The base π₀ model you want to finetune, options are:
  - [pepijn223/pi0_base_fp32](https://huggingface.co/pepijn223/pi0_base_fp32)
  - [pepijn223/pi0_libero_fp32](https://huggingface.co/pepijn223/pi0_libero_fp32) (specifically trained on the Libero dataset)
  - [pepijn223/pi0_droid_fp32](https://huggingface.co/pepijn223/pi0_droid_fp32) (specifically trained on the Droid dataset)
