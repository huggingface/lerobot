# Multi-GPU Training

This guide shows you how to train policies on multiple GPUs using [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate).

## Installation

First, ensure you have accelerate installed:

```bash
pip install accelerate
```

## Training with Multiple GPUs

You can launch training in two ways:

### Option 1: Without config (specify parameters directly)

You can specify all parameters directly in the command without running `accelerate config`:

```bash
accelerate launch \
  --multi_gpu \
  --num_processes=2 \
  $(which lerobot-train) \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_dataset \
  --policy.type=act \
  --policy.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_trained_policy \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/act_multi_gpu \
  --job_name=act_multi_gpu \
  --wandb.enable=true
```

**Key accelerate parameters:**

- `--multi_gpu`: Enable multi-GPU training
- `--num_processes=2`: Number of GPUs to use
- `--mixed_precision=fp16`: Use fp16 mixed precision (or `bf16` if supported)

### Option 2: Using accelerate config

If you prefer to save your configuration, you can optionally configure accelerate for your hardware setup by running:

```bash
accelerate config
```

This interactive setup will ask you questions about your training environment (number of GPUs, mixed precision settings, etc.) and saves the configuration for future use. For a simple multi-GPU setup on a single machine, you can use these recommended settings:

- Compute environment: This machine
- Number of machines: 1
- Number of processes: (number of GPUs you want to use)
- GPU ids to use: (leave empty to use all)
- Mixed precision: fp16 or bf16 (recommended for faster training)

Then launch training with:

```bash
accelerate launch $(which lerobot-train) \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_dataset \
  --policy.type=act \
  --policy.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_trained_policy \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/act_multi_gpu \
  --job_name=act_multi_gpu \
  --wandb.enable=true
```

## How It Works

When you launch training with accelerate:

1. **Automatic detection**: LeRobot automatically detects if it's running under accelerate
2. **Data distribution**: Your batch is automatically split across GPUs
3. **Gradient synchronization**: Gradients are synchronized across GPUs during backpropagation
4. **Single process logging**: Only the main process logs to wandb and saves checkpoints

## Learning Rate and Steps Auto-Scaling

By default, LeRobot keeps your hyperparameters exactly as you set them. If you want automatic scaling when using multiple GPUs, enable it with `--auto_scale=true`.

When `--auto_scale=true` is enabled and training runs with multiple processes (GPUs), LeRobot will:

- Multiply the optimizer learning rate by the number of processes (linear LR scaling)
- Divide the total number of training steps by the number of processes

This keeps the total number of samples and overall training dynamics roughly consistent across different GPU counts.

Example with 2 GPUs:

```bash
accelerate launch --num_processes=2 $(which lerobot-train) \
  --dataset.repo_id=lerobot/pusht \
  --policy.type=act \
  --batch_size=8 \
  --steps=100000 \
  --auto-scale=true
```

The effective behavior will be approximately:

- Optimizer LR: `lr × 2`
- Steps: `100000 → 50000`

Notes:

- Auto-scaling is skipped when resuming from a checkpoint to preserve training state.
- If you prefer manual control, omit `--auto-scale` and set `--optimizer.lr` and `--steps` yourself.

## Notes

- The `--policy.use_amp` flag in `lerobot-train` is only used when **not** running with accelerate. When using accelerate, mixed precision is controlled by accelerate's configuration.
- Training logs, checkpoints, and hub uploads are only done by the main process to avoid conflicts. Non-main processes have console logging disabled to prevent duplicate output.
- The effective batch size is `batch_size × num_gpus`. If you use 4 GPUs with `--batch_size=8`, your effective batch size is 32.
- Learning rate scheduling is handled correctly across multiple processes—LeRobot sets `step_scheduler_with_optimizer=False` to prevent accelerate from adjusting scheduler steps based on the number of processes.
- When saving or pushing models, LeRobot automatically unwraps the model from accelerate's distributed wrapper to ensure compatibility.
- WandB integration automatically initializes only on the main process, preventing multiple runs from being created.
