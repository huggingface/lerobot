# LeRobot

**State-of-the-art machine learning for real-world robotics**

ðŸ¤— LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier for entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.

ðŸ¤— LeRobot contains state-of-the-art approaches that have been shown to transfer to the real-world with a focus on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

ðŸ¤— LeRobot already provides a set of pretrained models, datasets with human collected demonstrations, and simulated environments so that everyone can get started.

ðŸ¤— LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on the LeRobot HuggingFace page.
