# Use `act_real_no_state.yaml` to train on real-world Aloha/Aloha2 datasets when cameras are moving (e.g. wrist cameras)
# Compared to `act_real.yaml`, it is camera only and does not use the state as input which is vector of robot joint positions.
# We validated experimentaly that not using state reaches better success rate. Our hypothesis is that `act_real.yaml` might
# overfits to the state, because the images are more complex to learn from since they are moving.
#
# Example of usage for training:
# ```bash
# python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
#   policy=act_real_no_state \
#   env=dora_aloha_real
# ```
