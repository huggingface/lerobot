# Koch Screwdriver

The Koch Screwdriver robot is based on the Koch v1.1, but fitted with a screwdriver instead of a gripper.
See the [Koch v1.1](https://github.com/lerobot/lerobot/blob/main/common/robots/koch_v1.1/koch_v1.1.mdx) documentation for instructions on building the base robot.
The calibration procedure is identical to that of the Koch v1.1.

## How It Works
The screwdriver modification uses the same Dynamixel motor as the Koch v1.1 gripper, but operates it in wheel (also known as velocity) mode.
The movable part of the gripper has been replaced by a magnetic screwdriver holder, and the static part of the gripper has been removed.

## Screwdriver Hardware

The STL files and bill of materials for the screwdriver hardware can be found in the [Koch robotic arm screwdriver](https://github.com/jackvial/koch_robotic_arm_screwdriver) GitHub repository.
