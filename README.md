    <p>LeRobot: State-of-the-art AI for real-world robotics</p>
</h3>

---

🤗 LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.

🤗 LeRobot contains state-of-the-art approaches that have been shown to transfer to the real-world with a focus on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

🤗 LeRobot already provides a set of pretrained models, datasets with human collected demonstrations, and simulation environments to get started without assembling a robot. In the coming weeks, the plan is to add more and more support for real-world robotics on the most affordable and capable robots out there.

🤗 LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on this Hugging Face community page: [huggingface.co/lerobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)

## Installation

LeRobot works with Python 3.10+ and PyTorch 2.2+.

### Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and activate it, e.g. with [`miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/):

```bash
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.10
conda activate lerobot
```

When using `conda`, install `ffmpeg` in your environment:

```bash
conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
```

> **NOTE:** This usually installs `ffmpeg 7.X` for your platform compiled with the `libsvtav1` encoder. If `libsvtav1` is not supported (check supported encoders with `ffmpeg -encoders`), you can:
>
> - _[On any platform]_ Explicitly install `ffmpeg 7.X` using:
>
> ```bash
> conda install ffmpeg=7.1.1 -c conda-forge
> ```
>
> - _[On Linux only]_ Install [ffmpeg build dependencies](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu#GettheDependencies) and [compile ffmpeg from source with libsvtav1](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu#libsvtav1), and make sure you use the corresponding ffmpeg binary to your install with `which ffmpeg`.

### Install LeRobot 🤗

#### From Source

First, clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
```

Then, install the library in editable mode. This is useful if you plan to contribute to the code.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **NOTE:** If you encounter build errors, you may need to install additional dependencies (`cmake`, `build-essential`, and `ffmpeg libs`). On Linux, run:
> `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential python3-dev pkg-config libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev`. For other systems, see: [Compiling PyAV](https://pyav.org/docs/develop/overview/installation.html#bring-your-own-ffmpeg)

For simulations, 🤗 LeRobot comes with gymnasium environments that can be installed as extras:

- [aloha](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-aloha)
- [xarm](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-xarm)
- [pusht](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-pusht)

For instance, to install 🤗 LeRobot with aloha and pusht, use:

```bash
pip install -e ".[aloha, pusht]"
```

### Installation from PyPI

**Core Library:**
Install the base package with:

```bash
pip install lerobot
```

_This installs only the default dependencies._

**Extra Features:**
To install additional functionality, use one of the following:

```bash
pip install 'lerobot[all]'          # All available features
pip install 'lerobot[aloha,pusht]'  # Specific features (Aloha & Pusht)
pip install 'lerobot[feetech]'      # Feetech motor support
```

_Replace `[...]` with your desired features._

**Available Tags:**
For a full list of optional dependencies, see:
https://pypi.org/project/lerobot/

> [!NOTE]
> For lerobot 0.4.0, if you want to install pi tags, you will have to do: `pip install "lerobot[pi]@git+https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git"`.
>
> This will be solved in the next patch release

### Weights & Biases

To use [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for experiment tracking, log in with

```bash
wandb login
```

(note: you will also need to enable WandB in the configuration. See below.)

### Visualize datasets

Check out [example 1](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/dataset/load_lerobot_dataset.py) that illustrates how to use our dataset class which automatically downloads data from the Hugging Face hub.

You can also locally visualize episodes from a dataset on the hub by executing our script from the command line:

```bash
lerobot-dataset-viz \
    --repo-id lerobot/pusht \
    --episode-index 0
```

or from a dataset in a local folder with the `root` option and the `--mode local` (in the following case the dataset will be searched for in `./my_local_data_dir/lerobot/pusht`)

```bash
lerobot-dataset-viz \
    --repo-id lerobot/pusht \
    --root ./my_local_data_dir \
    --mode local \
    --episode-index 0
```

It will open `rerun.io` and display the camera streams, robot states and actions, like this:

https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/4681518/328035972-fd46b787-b532-47e2-bb6f-fd536a55a7ed.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAVCODYLSA53PQK4ZA%2F20240505%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240505T172924Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=d680b26c532eeaf80740f08af3320d22ad0b8a4e4da1bcc4f33142c15b509eda&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=24889239&key_id=0&repo_id=748713144

Our script can also visualize datasets stored on a distant server. See `lerobot-dataset-viz --help` for more instructions.

### The `LeRobotDataset` format

A dataset in `LeRobotDataset` format is very simple to use. It can be loaded from a repository on the Hugging Face hub or a local folder simply with e.g. `dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_static_coffee")` and can be indexed into like any Hugging Face and PyTorch dataset. For instance `dataset[0]` will retrieve a single temporal frame from the dataset containing observation(s) and an action as PyTorch tensors ready to be fed to a model.

A specificity of `LeRobotDataset` is that, rather than retrieving a single frame by its index, we can retrieve several frames based on their temporal relationship with the indexed frame, by setting `delta_timestamps` to a list of relative times with respect to the indexed frame. For example, with `delta_timestamps = {"observation.image": [-1, -0.5, -0.2, 0]}` one can retrieve, for a given index, 4 frames: 3 "previous" frames 1 second, 0.5 seconds, and 0.2 seconds before the indexed frame, and the indexed frame itself (corresponding to the 0 entry). See example [1_load_lerobot_dataset.py](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/dataset/load_lerobot_dataset.py) for more details on `delta_timestamps`.

Under the hood, the `LeRobotDataset` format makes use of several ways to serialize data which can be useful to understand if you plan to work more closely with this format. We tried to make a flexible yet simple dataset format that would cover most type of features and specificities present in reinforcement learning and robotics, in simulation and in real-world, with a focus on cameras and robot states but easily extended to other types of sensory inputs as long as they can be represented by a tensor.

Here are the important details and internal structure organization of a typical `LeRobotDataset` instantiated with `dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_static_coffee")`. The exact features will change from dataset to dataset but not the main aspects:

```
dataset attributes:
  ├ hf_dataset: a Hugging Face dataset (backed by Arrow/parquet). Typical features example:
  │  ├ observation.images.cam_high (VideoFrame):
  │  │   VideoFrame = {'path': path to a mp4 video, 'timestamp' (float32): timestamp in the video}
  │  ├ observation.state (list of float32): position of an arm joints (for instance)
  │  ... (more observations)
  │  ├ action (list of float32): goal position of an arm joints (for instance)
  │  ├ episode_index (int64): index of the episode for this sample
  │  ├ frame_index (int64): index of the frame for this sample in the episode ; starts at 0 for each episode
  │  ├ timestamp (float32): timestamp in the episode
  │  ├ next.done (bool): indicates the end of an episode ; True for the last frame in each episode
  │  └ index (int64): general index in the whole dataset
  ├ meta: a LeRobotDatasetMetadata object containing:
  │  ├ info: a dictionary of metadata on the dataset
  │  │  ├ codebase_version (str): this is to keep track of the codebase version the dataset was created with
  │  │  ├ fps (int): frame per second the dataset is recorded/synchronized to
  │  │  ├ features (dict): all features contained in the dataset with their shapes and types
  │  │  ├ total_episodes (int): total number of episodes in the dataset
  │  │  ├ total_frames (int): total number of frames in the dataset
  │  │  ├ robot_type (str): robot type used for recording
  │  │  ├ data_path (str): formattable string for the parquet files
  │  │  └ video_path (str): formattable string for the video files (if using videos)
  │  ├ episodes: a DataFrame containing episode metadata with columns:
  │  │  ├ episode_index (int): index of the episode
  │  │  ├ tasks (list): list of tasks for this episode
  │  │  ├ length (int): number of frames in this episode
  │  │  ├ dataset_from_index (int): start index of this episode in the dataset
  │  │  └ dataset_to_index (int): end index of this episode in the dataset
  │  ├ stats: a dictionary of statistics (max, mean, min, std) for each feature in the dataset, for instance
  │  │  ├ observation.images.front_cam: {'max': tensor with same number of dimensions (e.g. `(c, 1, 1)` for images, `(c,)` for states), etc.}
  │  │  └ ...
  │  └ tasks: a DataFrame containing task information with task names as index and task_index as values
  ├ root (Path): local directory where the dataset is stored
  ├ image_transforms (Callable): optional image transformations to apply to visual modalities
  └ delta_timestamps (dict): optional delta timestamps for temporal queries
```

A `LeRobotDataset` is serialised using several widespread file formats for each of its parts, namely:

- hf_dataset stored using Hugging Face datasets library serialization to parquet
- videos are stored in mp4 format to save space
- metadata are stored in plain json/jsonl files

Dataset can be uploaded/downloaded from the HuggingFace hub seamlessly. To work on a local dataset, you can specify its location with the `root` argument if it's not in the default `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` location.

#### Reproduce state-of-the-art (SOTA)

We provide some pretrained policies on our [hub page](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) that can achieve state-of-the-art performances.
You can reproduce their training by loading the config from their run. Simply running:

```bash
lerobot-train --config_path=lerobot/diffusion_pusht
```

reproduces SOTA results for Diffusion Policy on the PushT task.

## Contribute

If you would like to contribute to 🤗 LeRobot, please check out our [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Add a pretrained policy

Once you have trained a policy you may upload it to the Hugging Face hub using a hub id that looks like `${hf_user}/${repo_name}` (e.g. [lerobot/diffusion_pusht](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/diffusion_pusht)).

You first need to find the checkpoint folder located inside your experiment directory (e.g. `outputs/train/2024-05-05/20-21-12_aloha_act_default/checkpoints/002500`). Within that there is a `pretrained_model` directory which should contain:

- `config.json`: A serialized version of the policy configuration (following the policy's dataclass config).
- `model.safetensors`: A set of `torch.nn.Module` parameters, saved in [Hugging Face Safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index) format.
- `train_config.json`: A consolidated configuration containing all parameters used for training. The policy configuration should match `config.json` exactly. This is useful for anyone who wants to evaluate your policy or for reproducibility.

To upload these to the hub, run the following:

```bash
huggingface-cli upload ${hf_user}/${repo_name} path/to/pretrained_model
```

See [lerobot_eval.py](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/src/lerobot/scripts/lerobot_eval.py) for an example of how other people may use your policy.
