class ToBatchProcessor:
    """Processor that adds batch dimensions to observations and actions when needed.

    This processor ensures that observations and actions have proper batch dimensions for model processing:

    - For state observations (observation.state, observation.environment_state):
      Adds batch dimension (unsqueeze at dim=0) if tensor is 1-dimensional

    - For image observations (observation.image, observation.images.*):
      Adds batch dimension (unsqueeze at dim=0) if tensor is 3-dimensional (H, W, C)

    - For actions:
      Adds batch dimension (unsqueeze at dim=0) if tensor is 1-dimensional

    - For task field in complementary data:
      Wraps string task in a list to add batch dimension
      (task must be a string or list of strings)

    This is useful when processing single transitions that need to be batched for
    model inference or when converting from unbatched environment outputs to
    batched model inputs.

    The processor only modifies tensors that need batching and leaves already
    batched tensors unchanged.

    Example:
        ```python
        # State: (7,) -> (1, 7)
        # Image: (224, 224, 3) -> (1, 224, 224, 3)
        # Action: (4,) -> (1, 4)
        # Task: "pick_cube" -> ["pick_cube"]
        # Already batched: (1, 7) -> (1, 7) [unchanged]
        ```
