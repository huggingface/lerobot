@dataclass
class _NormalizationMixin:
    """
    A mixin class providing core functionality for normalization and unnormalization.

    This class manages normalization statistics (`stats`), converts them to tensors for
    efficient computation, handles device placement, and implements the logic for
    applying normalization transformations (mean/std and min/max). It is designed to
    be inherited by concrete `ProcessorStep` implementations and should not be used
    directly.

    **Stats Override Preservation:**
    When stats are explicitly provided during construction (e.g., via overrides in
    `DataProcessorPipeline.from_pretrained()`), they are preserved even when
    `load_state_dict()` is called. This allows users to override normalization
    statistics from saved models while keeping the rest of the model state intact.

    Examples:
        ```python
        # Common use case: Override with dataset stats
        from lerobot.datasets import LeRobotDataset

        dataset = LeRobotDataset("my_dataset")
        pipeline = DataProcessorPipeline.from_pretrained(
            "model_path", overrides={"normalizer_processor": {"stats": dataset.meta.stats}}
        )
        # dataset.meta.stats will be used, not the stats from the saved model

        # Custom stats override
        custom_stats = {"action": {"mean": [0.0], "std": [1.0]}}
        pipeline = DataProcessorPipeline.from_pretrained(
            "model_path", overrides={"normalizer_processor": {"stats": custom_stats}}
        )
        ```

    Attributes:
        features: A dictionary mapping feature names to `PolicyFeature` objects, defining
            the data structure to be processed.
        norm_map: A dictionary mapping `FeatureType` to `NormalizationMode`, specifying
            which normalization method to use for each type of feature.
        stats: A dictionary containing the normalization statistics (e.g., mean, std,
            min, max) for each feature.
        device: The PyTorch device on which to store and perform tensor operations.
        eps: A small epsilon value to prevent division by zero in normalization
            calculations.
        normalize_observation_keys: An optional set of keys to selectively apply
            normalization to specific observation features.
        _tensor_stats: An internal dictionary holding the normalization statistics as
            PyTorch tensors.
        _stats_explicitly_provided: Internal flag tracking whether stats were explicitly
            provided during construction (used for override preservation).
