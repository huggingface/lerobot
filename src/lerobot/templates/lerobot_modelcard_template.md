# Model Card for {{ model_name | default("Model ID", true) }}

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

{% if model_name == "smolvla" %}
[SmolVLA](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01844) is a compact, efficient vision-language-action model that achieves competitive performance at reduced computational costs and can be deployed on consumer-grade hardware.
{% elif model_name == "act" %}
[Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2304.13705) is an imitation-learning method that predicts short action chunks instead of single steps. It learns from teleoperated data and often achieves high success rates.
{% elif model_name == "tdmpc" %}
[TD-MPC](https://huggingface.co/papers/2203.04955) combines model-free and model-based approaches to improve sample efficiency and performance in continuous control tasks by using a learned latent dynamics model and terminal value function.
{% elif model_name == "diffusion" %}
[Diffusion Policy](https://huggingface.co/papers/2303.04137) treats visuomotor control as a generative diffusion process, producing smooth, multi-step action trajectories that excel at contact-rich manipulation.
{% elif model_name == "vqbet" %}
[VQ-BET](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.03181) combines vector-quantised action tokens with Behaviour Transformers to discretise control and achieve data-efficient imitation across diverse skills.
{% elif model_name == "pi0" %}
[Pi0](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.24164) is a generalist vision-language-action transformer that converts multimodal observations and text instructions into robot actions for zero-shot task transfer.
{% elif model_name == "pi0fast" %}
[Pi0-Fast](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.09747) is a variant of Pi0 that uses a new tokenization method called FAST, which enables training of an autoregressive vision-language-action policy for high-frequency robotic tasks with improved performance and reduced training time.
{% elif model_name == "sac" %}
[Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)](https://huggingface.co/papers/1801.01290) is an entropy-regularised actor-critic algorithm offering stable, sample-efficient learning in continuous-control environments.
{% elif model_name == "reward_classifier" %}
A reward classifier is a lightweight neural network that scores observations or trajectories for task success, providing a learned reward signal or offline evaluation when explicit rewards are unavailable.

## How to Get Started with the Model

For a complete walkthrough, see the [training guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/il_robots#train-a-policy).
Below is the short version on how to train and run inference/eval:

### Train from scratch

```bash
python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/<dataset> \
  --policy.type=act \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/<desired_policy_repo_id> \
  --job_name=lerobot_training \
  --policy.device=cuda \
  --policy.repo_id=${HF_USER}/<desired_policy_repo_id>
  --wandb.enable=true
```

*Writes checkpoints to `outputs/train/<desired_policy_repo_id>/checkpoints/`.*

### Evaluate the policy/run inference

```bash
python -m lerobot.record \
  --robot.type=so100_follower \
  --dataset.repo_id=<hf_user>/eval_<dataset> \
  --policy.path=<hf_user>/<desired_policy_repo_id> \
  --episodes=10
```

Prefix the dataset repo with **eval\_** and supply `--policy.path` pointing to a local or hub checkpoint.
