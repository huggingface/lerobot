class Reachy2CameraConfig(CameraConfig):
    """Configuration class for Reachy 2 camera devices.

    This class provides configuration options for Reachy 2 cameras,
    supporting both the teleop and depth cameras. It includes settings
    for resolution, frame rate, color mode, and the selection of the cameras.

    Example configurations:
    ```python
    # Basic configurations
    Reachy2CameraConfig(
        name="teleop",
        image_type="left",
        ip_address="192.168.0.200",  # IP address of the robot
        fps=15,
        width=640,
        height=480,
        color_mode=ColorMode.RGB,
    )  # Left teleop camera, 640x480 @ 15FPS
    ```

    Attributes:
        name: Name of the camera device. Can be "teleop" or "depth".
        image_type: Type of image stream. For "teleop" camera, can be "left" or "right".
                    For "depth" camera, can be "rgb" or "depth". (depth is not supported yet)
        fps: Requested frames per second for the color stream.
        width: Requested frame width in pixels for the color stream.
        height: Requested frame height in pixels for the color stream.
        color_mode: Color mode for image output (RGB or BGR). Defaults to RGB.
        ip_address: IP address of the robot. Defaults to "localhost".
        port: Port number for the camera server. Defaults to 50065.

    Note:
        - Only 3-channel color output (RGB/BGR) is currently supported.
