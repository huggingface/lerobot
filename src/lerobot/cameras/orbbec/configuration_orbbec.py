class OrbbecCameraConfig(CameraConfig):
    """Configuration class for Orbbec cameras accessed through pyorbbecsdk.

    This class provides configuration options for Orbbec cameras, identifying the
    device via its serial number or a unique human-readable name. This first version
    is color-only: depth capture is intentionally not implemented so LeRobot dataset
    image features keep the usual RGB shape.

    Example configurations for an Orbbec Gemini 335:
    ```python
    # Basic configurations
    OrbbecCameraConfig("CP1234567890", 30, 1280, 720)  # 1280x720 @ 30FPS
    OrbbecCameraConfig("CP1234567890", 60, 640, 480)  # 640x480 @ 60FPS

    # Advanced configurations
    OrbbecCameraConfig("CP1234567890", 30, 640, 480, rotation=Cv2Rotation.ROTATE_90)  # With 90° rotation
    ```

    Attributes:
        fps: Requested frames per second for the color stream.
        width: Requested frame width in pixels for the color stream.
        height: Requested frame height in pixels for the color stream.
        serial_number_or_name: Unique serial number or human-readable name to identify the camera.
        color_mode: Color mode for image output (RGB or BGR). Defaults to RGB.
        rotation: Image rotation setting (0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°). Defaults to no rotation.
        warmup_s: Time reading frames before returning from connect (in seconds).

    Note:
        - Either the name or the serial number must be specified.
        - When identifying a camera by name, ensure only one camera with that name is connected.
        - The actual resolution and FPS may be adjusted by the camera to the nearest supported mode.
        - For `fps`, `width` and `height`, either all of them need to be set, or none of them.
