class VQBeTConfig(PreTrainedConfig):
    """Configuration class for VQ-BeT.

    Defaults are configured for training with PushT providing proprioceptive and single camera observations.

    The parameters you will most likely need to change are the ones which depend on the environment / sensors.
    Those are: `input_shapes` and `output_shapes`.

    Notes on the inputs and outputs:
        - "observation.state" is required as an input key.
        - At least one key starting with "observation.image is required as an input.
        - If there are multiple keys beginning with "observation.image" they are treated as multiple camera
          views. Right now we only support all images having the same shape.
        - "action" is required as an output key.

    Args:
        n_obs_steps: Number of environment steps worth of observations to pass to the policy (takes the
            current step and additional steps going back).
        n_action_pred_token: Total number of current token and future tokens that VQ-BeT predicts.
        action_chunk_size: Action chunk size of each action prediction token.
        input_shapes: A dictionary defining the shapes of the input data for the policy.
            The key represents the input data name, and the value is a list indicating the dimensions
            of the corresponding data. For example, "observation.image" refers to an input from
            a camera with dimensions [3, 96, 96], indicating it has three color channels and 96x96 resolution.
            Importantly, shapes doesnt include batch dimension or temporal dimension.
        output_shapes: A dictionary defining the shapes of the output data for the policy.
            The key represents the output data name, and the value is a list indicating the dimensions
            of the corresponding data. For example, "action" refers to an output shape of [14], indicating
            14-dimensional actions. Importantly, shapes doesnt include batch dimension or temporal dimension.
        input_normalization_modes: A dictionary with key representing the modality (e.g. "observation.state"),
            and the value specifies the normalization mode to apply. The two available modes are "mean_std"
            which subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation and "min_max" which rescale in a
            [-1, 1] range.
        output_normalization_modes: Similar dictionary as `normalize_input_modes`, but to unnormalize to the
            original scale. Note that this is also used for normalizing the training targets.
        vision_backbone: Name of the torchvision resnet backbone to use for encoding images.
        crop_shape: (H, W) shape to crop images to as a preprocessing step for the vision backbone. Must fit
            within the image size. If None, no cropping is done.
        crop_is_random: Whether the crop should be random at training time (it's always a center crop in eval
            mode).
        pretrained_backbone_weights: Pretrained weights from torchvision to initialize the backbone.
            `None` means no pretrained weights.
        use_group_norm: Whether to replace batch normalization with group normalization in the backbone.
            The group sizes are set to be about 16 (to be precise, feature_dim // 16).
        spatial_softmax_num_keypoints: Number of keypoints for SpatialSoftmax.
        n_vqvae_training_steps: Number of optimization steps for training Residual VQ.
        vqvae_n_embed: Number of embedding vectors in the RVQ dictionary (each layer).
        vqvae_embedding_dim: Dimension of each embedding vector in the RVQ dictionary.
        vqvae_enc_hidden_dim: Size of hidden dimensions of Encoder / Decoder part of Residaul VQ-VAE
        gpt_block_size: Max block size of minGPT (should be larger than the number of input tokens)
        gpt_input_dim: Size of output input of GPT. This is also used as the dimension of observation features.
        gpt_output_dim: Size of output dimension of GPT. This is also used as a input dimension of offset / bin prediction headers.
        gpt_n_layer: Number of layers of GPT
        gpt_n_head: Number of headers of GPT
        gpt_hidden_dim: Size of hidden dimensions of GPT
        dropout: Dropout rate for GPT
        mlp_hidden_dim: Size of hidden dimensions of offset header / bin prediction headers parts of VQ-BeT
        offset_loss_weight:  A constant that is multiplied to the offset loss
        primary_code_loss_weight: A constant that is multiplied to the primary code prediction loss
        secondary_code_loss_weight: A constant that is multiplied to the secondary code prediction loss
        bet_softmax_temperature: Sampling temperature of code for rollout with VQ-BeT
        sequentially_select: Whether select code of primary / secondary as sequentially (pick primary code,
            and then select secodnary code), or at the same time.
