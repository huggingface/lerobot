# Real-Time Chunking (RTC)

This module contains the LeRobot implementation of **Real-Time Chunking (RTC)**, an inference-time technique for flow-matching based policies.

**Note**: RTC is not a policy itself, but rather an inference enhancement that works with flow-matching based policies including [π₀](../pi0/), [π₀.₅](../pi05/), and [SmolVLA](../smolvla/).
