# AI Usage Policy

The LeRobot project welcomes contributions from everyone, and we have a few guidelines regarding AI usage to ensure high code quality, clear communication, and a healthy open-source ecosystem:

- **Please disclose significant AI assistance.** If you used AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT) to generate a substantial portion of your code or text, let us know in your PR description. Transparency helps us review your changes more effectively.
- **Own your code (The Human-in-the-Loop).** You must fully understand all the changes you are proposing. If you cannot explain what your AI-assisted code does or how it interacts with LeRobot's broader architecture, please take the time to learn and test it before submitting.
- **Keep issues and discussions focused.** You are welcome to use AI to help draft issues or PR descriptions, but please review and edit them carefully before posting. AI can often be overly verbose; trimming the noise and getting straight to the point helps our maintainers address your needs faster.

Our core maintainers also use AI tools to aid their workflows, but they do so while bringing deep contextual knowledge of the LeRobot codebase to validate the output. We ask all contributors to apply that same level of rigor.

## Remember the Human Maintainers

Please remember that LeRobot is maintained by a dedicated team of humans.

Every discussion, issue, and pull request is read and reviewed by real people. While AI tools can generate thousands of lines of code in seconds, reviewing that code still takes human time and energy. Submitting unverified or low-effort AI output puts an unfair burden on our maintainers.

Today, the quality of the AI output still heavily depends on the developer driving the tool. We ask that you respect our maintainers' time by thoroughly vetting, testing, and refining your submissions.

## AI is Welcome Here

LeRobot operates at the cutting edge of AI and robotics, and many of our maintainers actively embrace AI coding assistants as valuable productivity tools. We are a pro-AI project!

Our reason for having an AI policy is not an anti-AI stance. Rather, it exists to ensure that AI is used to enhance human contributions, not replace them with unverified noise. It's about how the tools are used, not the tools themselves.

We value the unique human insight you bring to the LeRobot community. Let AI empower your workflow, but always let your own judgment take the wheel.
